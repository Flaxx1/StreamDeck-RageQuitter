---

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Download the program**: 
   - Clone this repository or download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/your-repo-link/releases) section.

2. **Prepare the configuration file**: 
   - Edit the `config.json` file to specify the paths to scan and the processes to exclude.

3. **Set up with Stream Deck**:
   - Add a "System" action in your Stream Deck software and point it to the `RageQuitter.exe` file.

---

## üìÑ Configuration

The program uses a `config.json` file to determine which folders to scan and which processes to exclude.

### Example `config.json`

```json
{
    "folder_paths": [
        "F:\\Steam\\steamapps",
        "F:\\Epic Games",
        "D:\\SteamLibrary"
    ],
    "exclude_process_names": [
        "wallpaperservice32_c.exe",
        "wallpaper32.exe",
        "EpicGamesLauncher.exe",
        "EpicWebHelper.exe"
    ]
}
```
- folder_paths: Add paths where the target processes are located.
- exclude_process_names: List process names to exclude from termination.

---

## üí° Usage

1. **Run RageQuitter**:
   - Double-click the `RageQuitter.exe` file to execute the program.
   - Alternatively, trigger it via your Stream Deck button configured with the `.exe`.

2. **Edit the Configuration**:
   - Open the `config.json` file in a text editor (e.g., Notepad, VS Code).
   - Add or remove folder paths under `"folder_paths"` to include or exclude specific directories.
   - Add or remove process names under `"exclude_process_names"` to manage which programs are ignored during termination.

3. **Test it**:
   - Run the program and ensure the desired processes are terminated while excluded processes remain unaffected.

4. **Automate with Stream Deck**:
   - Add the `.exe` file to a Stream Deck button as a "System > Open" action.
   - Press the button to instantly terminate processes based on your configuration.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Administrative Privileges**:
   Some processes may require admin rights to terminate. If RageQuitter does not work as expected, try running it as an administrator.

- **Use with Caution**:
   Be careful when adding folder paths to `config.json`. Ensure you only include directories with processes you intend to terminate, as the program will forcefully kill them.

## üñºÔ∏è Icon

RageQuitter comes with a custom skull icon for the `.exe` file. If you'd like to use your own icon:
1. Replace the `skull.ico` file with your desired `.ico` file.
2. Rebuild the `.exe` using the following PyInstaller command:
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --icon=your_icon.ico RageQuitter.py
